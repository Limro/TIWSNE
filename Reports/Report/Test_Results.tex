\section{Tests}
This section contains the description of the tests done during the mini project.



\subsection{Functionality test}



\subsubsection{Compression}

\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of the test is to test the compression and decompression of each compression type.

\textbf{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PC 
\item TelosB mote
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Connect the mote to the PC.
Load a the wanted compression type to the mote.
Open a terminal and connect the output from the mote to the terminal with the command \texttt{java net.tinyos.tools.PrintfClient -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telos}
Hit the RESET button on the mote.
Observe data in the terminal.




\subsubsection{Full System Test}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of the test is to test the full system functionality of the system in order to validate functionality before doing any energy measurements.

\textbf{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PC with TestSerial Java software
\item Receiver TelosB mote
\item Sender TelosB mote
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Connect the Sender TelosB mote to the PC. Load the image onto the sender TelosB using the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -w}.\\
When the transfer to the Sender TelosB mote is complete, reset the mote. 
The LED2 on the Receiver mote will light up when the wireless transmission is complete.\\
When the transmission is complete, connect the Receiver TelosB mote to the PC and execute the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -r}. 
Observe the reconstructed image on the PC.





\subsection{Energy Test}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of the test is to test the energy consumption of the full system functionality.

\textbf{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PC with TestSerial Java software
\item Receiver TelosB mote
\item Sender TelosB mote
\item Oscilloscope
\item 10 Ohm shunt resistor board
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Write the compression type to the two TelosB motes.\\
Connect the Sender TelosB mote to the PC. Load the image onto the sender TelosB using the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -w}.\\
When the transfer to the Sender TelosB mote is complete, set the oscilloscope to single mode and reset the mote. Observe the LED2 on the Receiver mode for when the wireless transmission is the complete. Observe and save the reading from the oscilloscope.\\
Connect the Receiver TelosB mote to the PC and execute the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -r}. Observe the reconstructed image on the PC.
