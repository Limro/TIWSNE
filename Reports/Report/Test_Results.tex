\section{Tests}
This section contains the description of the tests done during the mini project.
\subsection{Functionality test}
\subsubsection{Compression}
Each method in each compression type was tested seperately.
To keep it simple, a quick diagram was drawn to show what the expected outcome of some simple input would be, tested in seperate project solutions and validated.

For the One Bit Compression, an array with eight bytes in, all equal \texttt{0x0000 0010} was sent through the \texttt{Compress(...)} method.
The result was seven bytes, all equal \texttt{0x0000 0010} but the last, which was equal \texttt{0x0000 0011}.
The \texttt{Decompress(...)} had this output as input and its output validated to be all \texttt{0x0000 0010}.
\\
Next, we tried to send an array with eight bytes in, with increasing value from zero to seven. 
The output was, as expected, only even numbers since the last bit was sliced off.

The same approach was used for both the Two Bit Compression and the Four Bit Compression.

\subsubsection{Full System Test}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of the test is to test the full system functionality of the system in order to validate functionality before doing any energy measurements.

\textbf{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PC with TestSerial Java software
\item Receiver TelosB mote
\item Sender TelosB mote
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Connect the Sender TelosB mote to the PC. Load the image onto the sender TelosB using the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -w}.\\
When the transfer to the Sender TelosB mote is complete, reset the mote. Observe the LED2 on the Receiver mode for when the wireless transmission is the complete.\\
When the transmission is complete, connect the Receiver TelosB mote to the PC and execute the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -r}. Observe the reconstructed image on the PC.

\subsection{Energy Test}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of the test is to test the energy consumption of the full system functionality.

\textbf{Test equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PC with TestSerial Java software
\item Receiver TelosB mote
\item Sender TelosB mote
\item Oscilloscope
\item 10 Ohm shunt resistor board
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Write the compression type to the two TelosB motes.\\
Connect the Sender TelosB mote to the PC. Load the image onto the sender TelosB using the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -w}.\\
When the transfer to the Sender TelosB mote is complete, set the oscilloscope to single mode and reset the mote. Observe the LED2 on the Receiver mode for when the wireless transmission is the complete. Observe and save the reading from the oscilloscope.\\
Connect the Receiver TelosB mote to the PC and execute the terminal command: \texttt{Java TestSerial -r}. Observe the reconstructed image on the PC.
