\subsubsection{Compression}
Each method in each compression type was tested seperately.
To keep it simple, a quick diagram was drawn to show what the expected outcome of some simple input would be, tested in seperate project solutions and validated.

For the One Bit Compression, an array with eight bytes in, all equal \texttt{0x0000 0010} was sent through the \texttt{Compress(...)} method.
The result was seven bytes, all equal \texttt{0x0000 0010} but the last, which was equal \texttt{0x0000 0011}.
The \texttt{Decompress(...)} had this output as input and its output validated to be all \texttt{0x0000 0010}.
\\
Next, we tried to send an array with eight bytes in, with increasing value from zero to seven. 
The output was, as expected, only even numbers since the last bit was sliced off.

The same approach was used for both the Two Bit Compression and the Four Bit Compression.
