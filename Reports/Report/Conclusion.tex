\section{Discussion}
Why and How do we save energy by compressing?



\textit{\fxnote{Some of my thoughts on our compression.}
Our compression algorithms might not relate very well to the real world.
They are alot faster than e.g. JPEG, but not very effective at retaining image quality.
In a real project you might want to use e.g. JPEG, because it compresses more and retains image quality better, but it is more expensive to run.
We havn't tested how a very computational heavy compression with high compression rate compares to no compression.
But maybe we can give a qualified guess based on our results?}
