Mini - project  6:  Image Compression using TelosB mote.\\
Load a black and white image file from PC to a TelosBmote. The image is of size 256X256, each pixel of 8 bits.\\

Basic requirement:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make a simple compression operation of the image
\item Transmit the compressed image to the sink
\item The sink reconstructs the image
\item Analyze the energy consumption with w/o compression. 
\end{itemize}

Advanced study:
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply different compression operations of the image
\item Compare different compression algorithm in terms of computational cost and recovered image quality
\end{itemize}
